the port 4200: will be your front end where the angularjs work

For windows users(similar with MAC OS users)
because I used git bash:
1. After cloned from github
2. Follow Dita's instructions in README before this one then
2. use: ng serve
              in the client folder and wait until it compiled successfully
3. go to localhost:4200
4. Boom !! :)
